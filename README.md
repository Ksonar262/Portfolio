Hello, these are the programs that I have worked on as a part of my masters, dissertation, hobby projects and part time work as a research engineer at sheffield robotics. It encompasses work on digital twins, kalman filter, speech recognition, machine learning, path planning, SLAM and kinematics. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. 
Thank you!
